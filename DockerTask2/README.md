# lterm: Online bash terminal(emulator) tutorial

Check out the site live at:  [![lterm](https://img.shields.io/badge/webiste-live-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://sr6033.github.io/lterm/)	[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.svg)](https://gitter.im/lterm/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)

**lterm** is an online **Terminal Emulator**. It is a step by step tutorial that will teach you the **bash** commands by making you execute them.

*Nothing is better than learning by doing.*

It is fully online and doesn't require any extra shitty access. Being an emulator, it only virtualizes a terminal environment and so the commands executed doesn't effect either the server or your local machine.

### List of commands available presently

Command| Does...
:-----:|:-----:
`echo`|To display a string
`pwd`|Shows you the present working directory
`ls`|Lists all the files
`cd`|To change directory - change the current working directory to a specific directory
`cd ..`|Moves you up one directory(parent)

#### To add your new commands
- edit the file **<a href="https://github.com/sr6033/lterm/blob/master/js/main.js">main.js</a>** to add your commands.
- You don't have to worry about any other files or programs.

- If a **command** doesn't need further steps:

```
// without argument
ls: function() {
        this.echo('This is the ls command\n');
}
```

```
// with argument
echo: function(arg1) {
        this.echo('This is the echo command' + arg1 + '\n');
}
```

- If a **command** needs further steps:

```
cd: function(arg1) {
	this.push(function(cmd, term) {
                if(cmd == 'another_command')
                    this.echo('another_command');
		}, {
                    prompt: '[[b;#44D544;]lterm@localhost/' + arg1 + ':~$] ',
                   }
        );
}
```

---

**IMPORTANT**

- On addition of a new **command**, increase the size of `arr` array. This array acts like a counter to check if a **task/command** is completed or not.
- You need to add the new **command** into the second array `arr2` . This array stores all the commands and helps in fetching the **completed commands** when the **history** command is executed.
- Please make sure that you **do not alter the positions of commands** in `arr2`, You need to add the new command towards the last.
- Example: If I add the command - `echo`. I will add another 0 to the end of `arr`. Then I will make `arr[index] = 1` under `echo` command.
```
var arr = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; // Will add another 0 here. The place where you added is the index.
var arr2 = ['list of all other commands']; // Will add the 'echo' command here
...
...
echo: function(arg1) {
            arr[index_where_you_added_0] = 1;	// Will make the value at that index to 1. 	
            this.echo(arg1 + '\n');
            this.echo('> The [[b;#ff3300;]echo] command prints back your arguments.');
            this.echo('> Type [[b;#ff3300;]help] and check your first task is completed.');
            this.echo('> Now type [[b;#ff3300;]pwd] to continue.');
},

```

- You can also edit the **readme** and make it more user friendly to help out new contributors.

> **NOTE: Kindly keep the display of the terminal intact while making an update. A single extra space can make the look of the emulator little odd. So keep that in mind while printing something using `echo` command.**

> Note: Kindly have interpretable & good commit messages. Don't assume me to be some **Jedi** with powers to be able to make out every commit with a single word as message.
*May the Force be with you.*
